# Terraform Workflow

This directory contains examples and explanations of the core Terraform workflow commands and their usage.

## Terraform Workflow Commands

### 1. `terraform init`
- Initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files
- Downloads required providers and modules
- Creates the `.terraform` directory
- Initializes the backend configuration

```bash
terraform init
```

### 2. `terraform validate`
- Validates the configuration files in the directory
- Checks for syntax errors and internal consistency
- Does not access remote state or providers
- Ensures the configuration is valid before planning

```bash
terraform validate
```

### 3. `terraform plan`
- Creates an execution plan
- Shows what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state
- Compares the current state with the desired state
- Shows what will be created, modified, or destroyed
- Does not make any changes to actual infrastructure

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 4. `terraform apply`
- Applies the changes required to reach the desired state
- Executes the actions proposed in the plan
- Creates, modifies, or destroys infrastructure
- Updates the state file
- Requires explicit approval unless auto-approve is used

```bash
terraform apply
```

### 5. `terraform destroy`
- Destroys all resources managed by the Terraform configuration
- Removes infrastructure created by Terraform
- Updates the state file
- Requires explicit approval unless auto-approve is used

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Best Practices
1. Always run `terraform init` when starting a new project or after adding new providers/modules
2. Use `terraform validate` before planning to catch syntax errors early
3. Always review the plan before applying changes
4. Use version control for your Terraform configurations
5. Keep your state file secure and consider using remote state storage
6. Use workspaces to manage multiple environments
